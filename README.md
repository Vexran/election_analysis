## Overview of Election Audit

### The purpose of this challenge was to count all the votes of the 2018 congress elections of Diana Degette, Charles Casper Stockham, and Raymon Anthony Doane. Then, using python, I gathered all the ballots to show who won the election, which county was the biggest turnout, and the percentage of votes for each candidate.

### Election Audit Results
-The total number of ballots was 369,711

### Election Audit Summary
Here in this script, you can see how beneficial this can be; with technology growing faster than ever, this can provide accurate data on tallying ballots. With minor modifications, the script can use for any election that would be going on, not with just congress but with results in the presidential polls providing no errors. I have an example of how this can offer our help in the presidential election. Of course, you would have to make minor changes to the information provided. However, if you changed the script and provided it with presidential election polls, you can easily calculate the percentage of states, counties, and total votes of the entire election. This method would provide easy and accurate tracking of all the ballots and percentages. You can do this by quickly changing the script county names to state names; thus, you are now counting all the different states in the information. If you want to have both the county and condition, you can easily make another line of code stating that you wish to have the most prominent state turnout, and it will provide the percentage information.
